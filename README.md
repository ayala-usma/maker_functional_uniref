# maker_functional_uniref


## Modified scripts from MAKER to perform functional annotation of proteins using UniRef databases.

The current auxiliary scripts provided with MAKER to perform functional annotation of genes depend on the BLASTP results of the translated transcripts against UniProt database. However, UniRef databases are more comprehensive and might provide better results.

These Perl scripts were developed by Carson Holt (not me) and have been tested with UniRef90 database.
